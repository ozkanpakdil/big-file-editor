Implemented Tasks

- open very big file done.
- mouse wheel and go down in the file done.
- Ctrl+L and go to line done. this ability can be improved.
- catch page up page down or arrow keys for reading file line by line or pageSize pageSize done.
- go to end of file done.
- change file and save it nok.(actually for sequential progress it works fine. but if you went to line 14 million it can not save it yet.)
- search in the file nok.

now I need tests....
